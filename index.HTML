                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                 My name is Stephanie Minker, I am currently a student at Rutgers enrolled in the Full Stack Boot Camp program. 
                 The past 14 years I was in the mortgage industry working as a credit analyst. As this is a new career path for me my portfolio is small,
                 however I will be updating this site to showcase everything I learn.
