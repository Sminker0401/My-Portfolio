# My-Portfolio

## Description
The goal for making this page is to show a short introduction of who i am and the work i have completed thus far.
This is the first page I created from scratch to meet the acceptance criteria given to our class. 
I showcased my understanding of HTML semantic tags, CSS design aspects such as flexbox and media screen.
